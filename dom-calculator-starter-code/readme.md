** Brief **

1) Git repo with Dev and Master branches
2) Me and Joe added as contributors
3) Finished README.md with brief, what went well, the challenges and list of what you delivered
4) pull-request submitted by 9:00am tomorrow
5) The calculator should display the correct value for each button pressed in the browser
6) when the equals button is pressed you should display the result of the last entered calculation
7) the program should use functions, loops, DOM selectors and DOM events

** Problems **

The code is very long, I'm sure it could be reduced, didnt have time to finish the task.

** Good Points **

Far better understanding of Javascript after this task and how its constituent pieces work.
